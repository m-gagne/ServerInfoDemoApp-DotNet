# Server Info Demo App

An ASP.NET Razer web application that returns basic server info. Useful for when demoing load balanced web apps.

> Hint: you can change the colour of the VM image by changing the `vmColour` value in the web.config `<appappSettings>`. This is useful to visually show that a different server is serving the content.
